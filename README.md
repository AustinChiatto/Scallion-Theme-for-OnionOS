# Scallion Theme - Standalone
This is a repo for those who wish to download the theme while waiting for it to be accepted by the official repo.

- Contains both the original (green) and noir (black) theme files.

If you find any issues with either theme, please send me a message, and I'll do my best to resolve it.
