# Scallion Theme - Standalone
This is a repo for those who wish to download the theme while waiting for it to be accepted by the official repo.

- Contains both the original (green) and noir (black) theme files.

If you find any issues with either theme, please post a message in [Discussions](https://github.com/AustinChiatto/Scallion-Theme-for-OnionOS/discussions), and I'll do my best to resolve it.
